# Acrux Journal

This is a daily journal application made with p5.js. The basic idea is to construct "Goal Nodes" and then relate your daily journal entry to these goals. Currently I am working on adding my "gestureJS" project into this project. Every daily entry will have a corresponding user-created symbol to go onlong with it. When you work towards goals these goals will spawn symbols that are representitive of all the days that went into them.
